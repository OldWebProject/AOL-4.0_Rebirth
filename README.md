# OldWeb Project
I'm triying to rebirth the OldWeb!
I don't know if I can do this alone but if someone wants to help me, join my discord channel! https://discord.gg/tcrj9ccQ

I hope someone wants to help me with this project!
Have a nice day :)

# AOL 4.0 | The first progress I made
The first objects I managed to create are the main UI, Welcome Screen, BuddyView, Account Creating and Web Browsing. Currently I have some problems with the account creating because my LocalDB doesn't function but I don't know why. Currently I'm working on E-Mail sending and Chat functions but I'm thinking about making this later and starting to make some channels. Here are some pictures:

I hope you like it and I will work every day hard to finish this project :) Have a nice day!
