## What is the "Old Web"?
The Old Web is the past of the Internet called "Web 1.0". Internet pages looked simply, colorful and alive. In the past you couldn't go to the Web like you do today. You needed:
1. A program that takes you to the Internet(AOL,Netscape,...)
2. A Dial-Up Connection(Like 56K, 33,6K, ...)
Without that you couldn't go "online"! But now over the past 20 Years of new development and new functions, we managed to make more complicated and beautiful websites.
But as longer we stay on our minimalistic webistes, some of us miss the old times of the Internet. And that's why I'm here. I'm working currently alone and I want to start this project. I will try until I finish and I hope that some of you think the same as me. So I created the company: The Old Web Rebirth ©


!IMPORTANT: THE PROGRESS IS NOW ON THE PROGRESS BRANCH!
