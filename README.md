# AOL 4.0 | The first progress I made
The first objects I managed to create are the main UI, Welcome Screen, BuddyView, Account Creating and Web Browsing. Currently I have some problems with the account creating because my LocalDB doesn't function but I don't know why. Currently I'm working on E-Mail sending and Chat functions but I'm thinking about making this later and starting to make some channels. Here are some pictures:

I hope you like it and I will work every day hard to finish this project :) Have a nice day!

# AOL 4.0 | 06.24.2022 | Mail Center added
It took me long to get many resources to look how the channels once looked in this version. After I found everything, I started making the AOL Mail Center. Later I will add the function to write and read e-mails. This is how it looks:

# 06.25.2022 | Sign On, Sign In, Create Accounts
After many bugs I managed to get the function work that you can create an account and sign into AOL with your created screenname.
