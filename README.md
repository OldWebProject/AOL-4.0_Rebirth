# OldWeb Project
I'm triying to rebirth the OldWeb!
I don't know if I can do this alone but if someone wants to help me, join my discord channel! https://discord.gg/tcrj9ccQ

I hope someone wants to help me with this project!
Have a nice day :)

# AOL 8.0 Recreation
Because i don't know with what i should start, I will start with AOL 8.0. 
I have many issues at this time because i don't know how the channels looked and i don't know every function.
I'm working currently with C# in Visual Studio with WinForms and the latest NET.

This is how it looks currently. Weather and News are working! Only the News picture doesnt function because i don't know how to make this.
